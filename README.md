# Job Application Tracker
*- Junheng 2023*
### Functionalities:
This program is a tool to manage job applications. It will
help the users to:
- Set deadline reminders
- Keep on track of feedbacks
- Sorting the application
- Noting key information about the application

### Target User:
Anyone who is applying multiple positions, especially 
students are during school looking for coop or full time job after
graduating.

### Project Inspiration:
When I was applying coop position at UBC, I found PD portal
being really hard to use. And now I'm about to graduate, which
puts me in a position of making tons of applications again.
This makes me want to create this tool.

### User Story:
- As a user, I want to add/remove an application to my list of applications.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of applications.
- As a user, I want to change the status of my application: Not submitted / 
Waiting for reply / interview X/Y / rejected / ghosted (no reply after 30 days)
- As a user, I want to set deadlines for my "not submitted" applications
- As a user, I want to be able to save my applications to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my applications from file (if I so choose)

### Instructions for Grader
- To add a new application: Type in application company name, position name and deadline the press Add button.
- If there's no deadline for the application, deadline should be -1.
- To display applications with no deadline, press Show No Deadline Button.
- To go back press Refresh button.
- Press Save to save, message with image will pop up.
- Press Load to load, message with image will pop up.
